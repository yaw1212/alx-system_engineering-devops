# README for 0x05 Processes and Signals

## Description
This directory contains exercises and examples related to the topic of processes and signals in a Unix-like environment. Understanding processes and signals is fundamental in Unix-based systems for managing programs, communication between different processes, and handling various events.

## Table of Contents
1. Processes
2. Signals
3. Process Management
4. Signal Handling
5. Examples

## Processes
In this section, you will find explanations and examples related to processes, process IDs, parent and child processes, forking, executing processes, and more. Understanding how processes work is crucial for efficient resource management and program execution.

## Signals
This section covers signals in Unix systems. Signals are asynchronous notifications that can be sent to processes to notify them of specific events or to request actions. We discuss common signals like SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGINT, and how they can be used for process management.

## Process Management
Understanding how to manage processes is vital for system administrators and developers. This section deals with process monitoring, finding and killing processes, process priorities, and other related topics to streamline process management.

## Signal Handling
Signal handling allows processes to respond to various signals they may receive. This section provides insights into how signals can be caught and handled within programs, ensuring robustness and stability in signal-based communication.

## Examples
The examples/ directory contains practical examples and code snippets demonstrating concepts discussed throughout the repository. These examples aim to provide hands-on experience with processes and signal handling in Unix environments.

## Getting Started
To explore the contents of this repository and run the provided examples, ensure you have a Unix-like environment available. You can clone the repository and navigate through different sections to learn, experiment, and deepen your understanding of processes and signals.

## Contribution
Contributions to this directory are welcome. Feel free to suggest improvements, add new examples, or correct any errors you may find. By collaborating, we can enhance the learning experience for everyone interested in processes and signals.
